Mashreq o Signal Dashboard

-> Project Overview

This project is a Social Signal Dashboard built for Mashreq Bank as part of The Bounty Challenge Hackathon (Starter Pack).

The dashboard helps bank teams identify early public warning signals using synthetic data only.
It does not monitor individuals, does not use real customer data and does not trigger automated actions.

Instead, the system:
o Analyzes aggregated public chatter
o Explains why signals matter
o Shows confidence and uncertainty
o Routes insights to human reviewers for action (Human-in-the-loop)

All decisions remain human-led, supporting operational response while maintaining strong ethical boundaries.

-> Purpose

The dashboard is designed for internal Mashreq Bank teams (operations, communications, risk, and technical support) to:
o Detect early signs of service issues or rumors
o Understand public perception trends
o Review potential risks before escalation
o Respond responsibly with human judgment
o The website dashboard acts as a Human-in-the-Loop review tool, not an automated enforcement system.

🧪 What the System Simulates

The system simulates how people publicly discuss banking services when:
o An app or service faces issues
o Customer service experiences decline
o Brand sentiment begins to shift
o Rumors or scam-related discussions emerge
o All posts are synthetic and anonymized, generated purely for demonstration.

📊 Demonstrated Scenarios

The prototype demonstrates three key scenarios relevant to Mashreq Bank:

Service / Incident Signals
Example: Sudden spike in app login failures or service downtime

Brand Sentiment Shifts
Example: Rising negative sentiment around customer service or response times

Executive Insight Briefing
High-level leadership summary showing:

Key risks

Confidence levels

Suggested human next steps

🖥 Dashboard Experience

The dashboard is designed as a scroll-based interface:

Clicking a signal smoothly scrolls to detailed explanations

Information is layered progressively for clarity

Reviewers maintain full context while investigating signals

Key Sections Include:

Overview Dashboard
Displays overall risk level, trends, and top emerging signals

Signal Detail Section
Explains:

Why the signal matters

Evidence and drivers

Severity, confidence, and uncertainty

Human Review Section
Enables reviewers to:

Assign ownership

Track status

Add audit and reasoning notes

Executive Summary Section
Provides leadership with:

Concise risk overview

Confidence indicators

Recommended human actions

🧠 Explainable AI Logic

The system uses simple, transparent, and explainable logic to align with Responsible AI principles:

Grouping & Classification
Synthetic posts are grouped by topic and scenario

Trend Detection
Activity is compared across time windows to detect spikes and shifts

Scoring

Severity Score based on volume, speed, and negativity

Confidence Score based on repetition and similarity

Uncertainty Flagging
Signals are flagged when:

Volume is low

Sentiment is mixed or unclear

Every signal clearly explains why it was flagged.

🛡 Responsible AI & Governance

This prototype follows Responsible AI best practices:

✅ Synthetic data only

✅ No personal or customer data

✅ No surveillance or profiling
